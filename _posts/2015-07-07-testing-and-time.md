A feature of the [t-shirt a day project](/articles/-tshirt-a-day-serie/) allows a user to vote for a t-shirt when the current day is within a time period.


Hey ! I'm on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/selrahcd) too, if you want to discuss this method or something else. Feel free to comment below as well.
